# Project Name Melanoma Case Study
In this assignment, ask is to build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model which can evaluate the images and help the dermatologists to detect the presence of melanoma.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)
The dataset consists of 9 categories of diseases. We need to create a CNN model which can accurately detect 9 classes present n the dataset. Need to implement the concept the Data augmentation and handle class imbalance(if any) to sort out the model Overfit/Underfit issue
